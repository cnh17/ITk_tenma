# ITk_tenma
Code for communicating with the TENMA 72-2930 power supply
- Flavia's original code flagged
- Cathrine's edits as second flag
  - main.py changed to exhibit error in code as well as adding a for loop in order to do an IV scan
  - tenma.py changed so that for each scan, power source starts at V=0 and I=0, aswell as limit of power supply Voltage corrected to 0-30V instead of 0-20V.
